( 1)  Determine the installation directory on the host.

( 2)  Use git to download and checkout the appropriate version of kodeJS.  In
      the following example, use checkout to get the "steelblue" branch:

            # git clone https://github.com/KodeProgramming/kodeJS <path>/kodeJS

            # git checkout steelblue

( 3)  Ensure your application modules have been copied to the appropriate directory.

( 4)  Create a server configuration file by copying the example kodeJS.json file
      from <kode-path>/doc/examples/kodeJS.json.

( 5)  Before you run the kode framework for the first time, ensure you have your
      organization settings configured.

            "orgs": {
                "on": false,
                "dbms": "org_${fillNumber(5, oid)}"
            },

        "on" indicates whether the features pertaining to individual organizations
        will be enabled.  If on !== true, all server users will have not associated
        organization.

( 6)  Set the following flags:

        debug: debug mode disables browser file minification for debugging.

        cache: true to enable servers to cache data, false is for debuggings.

        cacheMB: If caching is enabled, limits the size of content to be cached.

        logging: "console" is primarily for development and troubleshooting.  Use
                 "dbms" for standard higher volumne operations.

        operator: this is where you put in your entity informatiaon for creating
                  a certification signing request (CSR).

        administrators: array of name and email addresses who are the system admins.

        network: enter your IP address, domain, and hostname.

        servers.http: To get a basic web application running, use the default settings
                      for the http server.

        smtp: The default should be set to "null", meaning the empty or black hole
              SMTP sending and receiving agent.

        modules: an array of paths, either relative or absolute, for application
                 modules that will be started by the kodeJS server.

( 7)  To start you system in developer mode, i.e., not as a service/daemon, become
      a privileged user and start the kode server:

            # sudo su

            # clear; node <path-to-kodeJS>/kodeJS/bootstrap.js /<path-to-kode.json>/kode.json

( 8)  For the first server start, you'll notice a number of messages pertaining to a
      database and database tables that were created.

( 9)  A user with the email of "charlie@kodeprogramming.org" is seeded into the application
      database in the user table.  The initial password is set to "password".  If you have
      started an application module with a web application, you will now be able to sign in
      as "charlie@kodeprogramming.org".

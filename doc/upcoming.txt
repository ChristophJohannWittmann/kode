/******************************************************************************
 *** List of Pinned/Pending Framework Issues
******************************************************************************/

** User Management -- Complete the entire lifecycle for user management processes
including but not limited to verification, password reset, email changes, grants,
grant plugins.

** Mail Gun Convig -- Complete a full Mail Gun configuration in order to complete
full lifecycle testing for SMTP messaging.

** WPanel State Management -- Add code to restore WPanel state management when
restoreState() is called.  Also need to maintain the Wpanel's state value as focus
shifts between descendents.

** Implement SMTP Filters -- Right now, the orginally factored SMTP filters are
sitting there in server/obj/smtp as comments.  They need to be refactored and added
back into the SMTP messaging algorithms.

** Websocket permessage-deflat -- The hook is there, we need to add in permessage-
deflate to the Websocket class.  Note that nodeJS ZLIB doesn't work so do a search
to determine which NPM will work for us.

** Create Organization DBMS -- If so configured in kode.json, create a new org
database when an organization is created.  If so configured, check exiting orgs
during boot to ensure they all have their own database.

** Scrub widget.css, webxStyles.js -- These two files form the bases for all styling
of framework widgets.  This needs a 2-week intensive scrubbing and color update
(for the framework).

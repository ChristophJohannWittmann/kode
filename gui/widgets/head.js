 * WHtml, WHead, and WBody are widget wrappers for the entire HTML document, the
 * HEAD, and the BODY elements respectively.  These are classes for specific
 * HTML elements because of their overall significance for the doc structure.
 * As needed, specialized features will be added to each of these classes to
 * help manage, encapsulate, and minimize the code throughtout the framework.
